# MVT-Memory-Management
MVT memory management and external fragmentation calculation
<br/>
<br/>MVT is a memory allocation scheme that allows multiple programs to run concurrently in a shared memory space. The memory is divided into fixed-size partitions and each partition is assigned to a process. The size of each partition can be adjusted based on the requirements of the process. When a process is terminated, its memory partition is released back into the pool of available memory for use by other processes. MVT allows for efficient use of memory resources by allocating memory based on process requirements, but it can suffer from fragmentation.
